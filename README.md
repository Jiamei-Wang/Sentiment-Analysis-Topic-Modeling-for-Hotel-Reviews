## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. 

## Project Motivation
The project goal is to use text analytics and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze hotel reviews and to help the hotel to identify factors that influence guest satisfactions.

## Data Description
I scraped reviews of "Hotel Beresford" (located in San Francisco, CA) from booking.com. The link of the hotel's review page is https://www.booking.com/reviews/us/hotel/beresford.html?

The scraped data are stored under 3 dataframes:
1) **reviewer_info**: Basic information of the reviewer and reviews:
    * Rating Score
    * Reviewer Name
    * Reviewer's Nationality
    * Overall Review (contains both positive & negative reviews)
    * Reviewer Reviewed Times
    * Review Date
    * Review Tags (Trip type, such as business trip, leisure trip, etc.)
2) **pos_reviews**Positive reviews
3) **neg_reviews**egative reviews

## Methodologies
1) Web Scraping
The hotel reviews were scraped from bookings.com by using requests with BeautifulSoup. 
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This part contais a pie chart, a histogram, and a seaborn violin plot to get a better understanding of the overall reviews and ratings.
3) WordClouds
In order to generate more meaningful WordClouds, I customized extra stop words and used lemmatization to remove closely redundant words.
4) Sentiment Analysis
The sentiment analysis helps to classify the polarity and subjectivity of the overall reviews and determine whether the expressed opinion in the reviews is mostly positive, negative, or neutral.
5) LDA Topic Model
I used GridSearch to tune the parameters: (1) n_components: number of topics and (2) learning_decay (which controls the learning rate) of the LDA model. I used the LDA model to extract the main topics within the negative reviews so that the hotel manager would know what the main issues are.

## Results
Hotel Beresford needs to improve hotel guest satisfaction by providing friendlier services and work on issues related to soundproofing, air conditioning, shower system and parking.Â The hotel also need to work on improving guests satisfaction towards the breakfast they provide, maybe coffee or pastries as appeared in the WordCloud.  
All the visualizations provided in the exploratory data analysis as well as the pyLDAvis interactive visualization would help the hotel manager to further understand what most popular topics within the negative reviews are and make improvements accordingly.
