1,"location more than made up for being outdated ...walking, trolley, and cable cars to many near by stores, shops, and attractions. The honor bar was semi reasonable in price and great variety....buuut ..there is a perfect little liquor store less then a minutes walk from the Hotel door."

15,"Pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The location was fantastic. We walked to attractions most days ( be prepared for hills) three steep hills until you are on the downwards. The breakfast was basic but fine. Staff always willing to help and always greeted you. Room was larger than I was expecting and was clean . The room was cleaned every day. We only ate in the white horse ( pub attached to hotel where breakfast is served ) on the last day . Wished we ate there all week . Very good value and tasted really good only order one meal between two or even three. When I was asked about my holiday I have already recommended this hotel to anyone saying they would like to go to San Fransico"

Rooms very small (we only had one suitcase, don't know where we would have put more).   This is a very old hotel and not earthquake safe (a plaque on the outside entrance wall tells you that!!).  However, location was good, short walk to Union Square and the tour buses etc.  Some of the staff were helpful, others not so much."

The hotel is dated but for a cheaper option in a brilliant location, it's perfect. I was slightly nervous of coming here due to some reviews, but trust me, hotel Beresford is ideal based for your San Francisco adventures."
64,"The breakfast was plentiful. It was conveniently located to everything. After a long day of sightseeing, it was great having a good restaurant in the building. Most of the staff was friendly and helpful. I had pulled some muscles while walking the city and a desk person helped me put together an ice bag.

100,"Location is excellent and very central. The hotel was clearly renovated recently, so the decor was fairly nice - except the bathroom, which was depressingly small and uncomfortable (hard to get the water to a normal temperature, either too hot or cold). Breakfast was OK, and located in a very cute British-style pub in the hotel. The street we were on felt pretty safe and well lit, although some of the surrounding streets felt a bit unsafe at night."

126,The first staff member to greet us was extremely helpful. He was informative and friendly. The following morning an older man was working the front desk who was unfriendly and rude.

189,"For an older hotel, the Beresford is surprisingly livable. Although the rooms are not large, they are sufficient for two folks with average amounts of gear. The bathroom is well-lit and there was plenty of hot water. Cleaner than I was expecting but it's nowhere near a higher quality place."
190,Great location.
191,The location is perfect. The staff is always friendly except the check in gal wasn‚Äôt as nice  as my last stay. Other staff were all very kind.

199,"The room, the hotel and the location were perfect and well priced for San Fran."
200,The price was great given the location which was just off Union Square. Breakfast was sufficient - a bowl of cereal with a pastry and coffee is the most we would have at home. Rooms are small but comfortable.
201,Location
202,We liked the location. We walked everywhere. It was nice to come back to several restaurants and bars. The attached bar has a good happy hour too. The hotel leaves beverages in the room and they are reasonably priced.
203,"Quiet. Comfortable beds. Incredible water pressure in the shower.
Our room (bathroom) was next to the elevator which was a bit disconcerting when we first heard the rumble. But it wasn't a problem and we never heard sounds from other guests. 
The neighborhood was very quiet at night and we could have our window open.
We had a good dinner and a good breakfast at Sutter Pub just one block away."

208,"Location
Wifi
Cleanliness"
209,This is the first hotel where the lobby appeal was misleading to the room appeal.  Many of the older hotels in SF put a lot of investment in the lobby and the room leaves a lot to be desired.  This hotel was the opposite.
210,The location and natural light inside the hotel
211,I like the hotel location and the room.
212,"The staff were helpful and courteous. Some of the best customer service in the US. The hotel is seriously creepy however, which we thoroughly enjoyed but others may find of putting."

223,We were allowed to store our luggage in the hotel after checking out so we were able to explore the city
224,"It was in a good location near to restaurants.  The breakfast was much better than we had been led to believe - maybe they had upped their game but the was a good variety including fresh fruit, cereal, pastries, all in abundance.  OK there was nothing cooked like eggs or waffles but plenty of other things to choose.  The staff were all very friendly although one was a little brash but that's America.  The room was clean and there was a fridge in the room too."
225,"Near the city Nice vintage looking"
226,Location. Secured baggage room.
227,Very nice hotel with European ambiance.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  Was upgraded upon arrival.  Room was next to elevator which made a lot of noise.  Overall very good location and pleasant stay.
228,"Shabby old- fashioned, good value"
229,Restaurant food was very good and drink prices were reasonable.
230,"The location of this hotel is great for visitors to the city. The value considering prices for rooms in the city is good. But, it‚Äôs a basic hotel, nothing more. The rooms are small with older furniture that‚Äôs still in good shape. The bed was ok, pillows were awful. The bathroom was minimally appointed & you have to ask for a hairdryer from the front desk.My room was quiet and served the purpose. I would stay there again if I was only there to sleep."
231,Location is ideal
232,"hotel is in the city center, near to financial center, cable car, metro"
233,Great location and good value for SFO. A nice older hotel. No air conditioning so not for summer stays.
234,Good value for the price. Location was excellent. It's a great place to stay if you're gonna be out all day long. Not noisy even though it's on a busy avenue.
235,Location was good & our room was located far at the end so no noise
236,"it is a great central location. We were able to take the BART train from the airport and then just walked up to the hotel. (It is a good 15min walk, though, so  it could be hard for some people). The building is old, historical and the restaurant section decorated in that spirit. I found it charming compared to the newer, standard, all-the-same  hotels. No air conditioning, but it was not too hot during our visit so it was fine. Some traffic noise, but did not bother us."
237,Bed was comfortable and lobby was cute and welcoming.
238,croissants good.  bed comfy.
239,We checked in early which seemed not to be a problem. They also up graded us as we requested.
240,I liked the location and its ambiance.  It was near Union Square and other places that I've gone.  Staff were friendly.
241,"The ambiance, very friendly service, comfortable room"
242,"The location of this hotel is really good. Staff are friendly. Rooms are in traditional style. Someone may say old but they are clean and cozy. Also, simple breakfast is provided, not fancy but good to start a day."

255,The staff
256,"Elevator worked well,staff helpful, location good for exploring. ...."
257,The location.
258,Staff made me feel welcomed - like I just came home from the military or something.  They teated me as if they knew me and was very concerned to get me setteled in.  They were willing to change my room and never once appeared as if it was too much trouble.
259,"Positives about this property - location and price...by far the cheapest for the location. Breakfast although minimal (pastries, fruit, cereal and juice) was generous, fresh and actually all we really wanted - we give that a huge plus from us). Wifi was good and reliable too.The room was small but adequate for what we needed, the bathroom was small with a weird sliding door, but the shower was really powerful and hot, which was lovely. Bed comfortable and TV facilities good. We didn't need air con or heating, but could have done with a kettle (no drink making facilities) and a lot of hassle to try and 'borrow' a hairdryer, even though we had emailed prior to arriving about this - apparently the hotel was fully booked and we had to use it then bring it straight back...how much would if cost to supply a small one in the room?? Staff were hit and miss, not exactly 'customer friendly' and a little blunt at times, but not terrible either, but it wasn't worth worrying about as the hotel was just a 'base'. They even decorated the hotel for Halloween, which was cute.Overall, a good place for the money and location, no real complaints -I found it clean, easy to come in and out, and just fine for our needs - I would recommend and want to stay again."
260,Good value and clean.
261,Location. 5 mins from union but street is calm. 10 mins from powell station.
262,Breakfast
263,"Affordable hotel located in downtown San Francisco next to very expensive hotels. All kinds of cuisines and shopping  are available within 5 minutes walk. Around the corner, 2 minute walk, is the Active gym that has very nice gym facilities, and a 25 yard swimming pool! For only US$10.00 you can get a card from the hotel for a single visit. Continental breakfast is OK. Ferry building (shops, and a farmer's market once or twice a week), SF bayfront,  are about 20 minutes walk."
264,Location was good
265,"Very good location. *****Really clean. *****"
266,"The staff were efficient and friendly. The position was excellent, only about 3 blocks from Union Square, but far enough away for there not to be any noise. At first we thought that the price was expensive, but soon realised that it was a good price in a very expensive city. The staff at most of the top hotels were on strike, so we were fortunate. They arranged our ride back to the airport."
267,"Location was good, the hotel is in the center of the city."
268,"I loved the friendly and interactive staff. Nice people, great attitudes."
269,"Location. Staff were good.Towels, bathroom amenities good.Valet parking very good, but rather expenses."
270,good central location. Liked the attached pub.
271,"Central to everything. Free breakfast was good. Rooms were clean, but very small. It was fine for the price. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you‚Äôre planning on spending anytime in the room, if you‚Äôre out all day and just need a place to sleep then this place will suit you fine."
272,"+ nice location of the hotel, close to the famous trolley and Pier 39+ very nice and helpful staff+ big bed in the room (we got a queensize bed)+ antique feel of the hotel if you're into things like that+ close are shops and many services (like dry cleaners)+ nice continental breakfast in the morning (good coffee, something to eat)"

286,"I was there for Dreamforce and the hotel was fine.  Nothing sexy, just a very basic room but I have no complaints.  Got a good night sleep.  There is a fan that runs all night which didn't bother me to much but worth noting if you end up with a room close to it."
287,Friendly staff;  good ambience.
288,Staff friendly and location great.
289,"Nice building in a great location only a few minutes walk from the BART station for airport transport and from Union square. (note walk is uphill though). Airport shuttle service and luggage storage also offered.Price (unusually for San Francisco) included basic continental breakfast; cereals, mini muffins, fresh fruit, croissants, juice and hot drinks.Room was a decent size with two (single) comfy beds and additional small table and chairs. Also included a fridge.San Francisco is expensive generally but this room felt like comparatively good value for the location. Would stay again for 1-2 nights but not a longer stay unless bathrooms were upgraded."

292,Location was perfect for sigthseeing and shooping. Beds very comfortable.
293,"Bed was nice (but wasn't expecting to sleep in a twin),  TV, shower, iron all worked well. Staff was friendly. I think the regular rates would match the value of the hotel, but I stayed during Dreamforce so I paid probably triple the regular rates."

316,Friendly staff Very helpful
317,Prime location
318,This is a very old historic building in the heart of San Francisco - don't stay if you expect new chain amenities - but given the prices in San Francisco this is a good value and was extremely close to the event we were attending.  We found it to be a nice change of pace.

320,"This is an older hotel but has a lot of charm. Location was great, just a few blocks from China Town and Union Square. Cable cars had a stop nearby, too. Breakfast was included. Nothing fancy but you could still get your croissant and a cup of coffee to start your day. Overall, very nice experience."

322,The historic attributes and the staff.
323,"Convenient for most of the main attractions if you like walking.

The attached restaurant and pub is 10/10, our best meal in the city and not cost inflated like other places. We would go back there for dinner even if not staying at the hotel. Waiter was very friendly as well."

341,Location and prove

349,"Great central location, cute design, polite and helpful service."
350,"Convenient location, good breakfast and dinner, friendly staff"
351,"Great location.  Slightly uphill from Union Square, but no steep hill to climb.  There is a wonderful Italian restaurant on the corner, Cesario's.  The hotel is a classic old San Francisco building with embossed wainscoting in the hallways.  We will definitely stay at Hotel Beresford again.  It is good value for the money.  It isn't as luxurious as other hotels, but we were very happy.  BTW - to people who complained about lack of air-conditioning - most buildings in SF don't have air-conditioning because you don't need it.  On the rare days it gets warm or stuffy in your room, just open the window and get some fresh air.  I lived in more than 10 places in SF over 17 years and none of them had air-conditioning and didn't need it."

365,Pretty good location in very close proximity to Union Square. Cheap. Stayed here because other hotels including preferred hotels were booked out. I do not recommend staying here unless you are desperate.

403,excellent service from the staffing
404,"The location, of course, was great. Two blocks from Union Square and the hop on hop off tours. But also the style of the hotel. It‚Äôs antique, without being old.

405,Location was good. They did let us check in early.
406,Great location. It was like stepping back in time once you walked inside. They did a fantastic job of modernizing while keeping the old world feel. I would definitely stay here again.

A couple of streets to the left it is sketchy but the immediate area was absolutely fine. I had no issues at all.  Room was really comfortable and clean. Pub downstairs is fine for bar type food and a nice drink. Most of the staff were really nice. Old building so not sound proofed but no more noisy than most other hotels.

The room we stayed in was absolutely comfortable and located in a quiet area, which I really appreciated.  The bed and pillow were super comfy. I slept like a baby!!  We missed the breakfast, but it is very nice to just go downstairs and grab some cereal, coffee and muffin. We opted to eat a a nearby diner. I definitely am looking forward to our next stay here.  Kudos to the check in staff who upgraded us to a king;  that was sooooo nice and we are grateful.  It made our birthday stay extra-special!"

The continental style breakfast was fine although cereal choice was ‚ÄòCheerios‚Äô. The place has the air of a family run hotel. In fact I think Grandad sits in the hall all day keeping an eye on things!This is a relatively cheap hotel rubbing shoulders with some of the most expensive hotels in the city. Good value for the area but don‚Äôt expect big price service and facilities."

This is an old scull hotel, but it's amazingly clean. All the staff is very nice. Bed was very comfortable. We were facing another building, so no view, but preferred that over street noise. There was the constant hum of a fan out the window, but that actually helped me sleep. 
Would definitely recommend this hotel."
