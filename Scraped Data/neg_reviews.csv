0,"Relatively basic, however it is great value for money. It provided everything I needed and had no complaints. Old fashioned building which I liked very much."
1,"The hotel is very dated with yellow staining on some tiles and cracked wallpaper....very ""old San Francisco"" feel to it. Our view was out the fire escape - not great for visiting from out of town. Be prepared to pay between 20 and 40+ a night for the ""valet"" parking near by."
2,Very old water pipes which made noises during the night.
3,"Breakfast was rubbish.... two types of flakes with coffee and a few buns and pastries. no orange juice, paper plates and bowls, plastic cutlery etc. nothing Hot."
4,The toilet is too low to the floor
5,"Staff was not very friendly or helpful. The woman who checked us in seemed very put out to have to do work, and was very very slow, and complained about people not listening to her. If you’re checking in, be prepared for it to take a while. She also rudely yelled at another guest who was checking out."
6,States that there is a fitness center. There is no fitness center for an avid gym goer.
7,The breakfast was very scant and the hotel seemed very run down
8,"The room itself was a bit dated, and the heater made a ticking noise sometimes. You could hear the other guests slightly through the walls. The breakfast was very basic and not extremely fulfilling."
9,The breakfast was pretty basic but ok.
10,There was no kettle in the room  and the shower was hard to get the right temperature.
11,Breakfast
12,You can hear all the noise through the wall and the door!
13,Heating is too much
14,"My room, 112, was a bit noisy due to a machine right outside the bathroom window that ran all night."
15,Were strict on guests. Should display that information up front.
16,"While the weather for San Francisco was unusually warm and beautiful, our room was on the 7th floor and quite warm.  The box fan helped, but only stirred the warm air.  The shower controls were a challenge to use.  Hard to adjust for good temperature."
17,"The walls are very thin. You can hear even small noises from the next door. 
I expected it as it is an old building, though.
The fact I stayed ain an unit at the end of the hall helped a bit 
No central heating unit. I can't remember when was the last time I stayed at a hotel with a radiator in a room. 
Transportation to the airport - I booked the shuttle but they were late. Waited 20 minutes and they didn't show up."
18,Hotel is quite noisy and you can hear movement in the hallway and room above you. Breakfast is very basic but sufficient. The coffee was terrible.
19,"The free breakfast was disappointing, no honey or lemon if you wanted tea. My husband and I were still very hungry afterwards and had to go out for breakfast."
20,Bathroom door was very difficult to slide closed; couldn't control the room temperature and it became hot in the morning; shower door was difficult to close; the beds were tiny and not very firm.
21,"I think for the price, it’s an excellent value. The rooms are older and nothing fancy, but that’s fine with me. It was clean and you can’t beat it for the location."
22,Shower needed a little work.
23,Rooms can be a bit small and feel stuffy but honestly for the price this is better than expected
24,"The hotel is very old - it is a blessing and a curse at the same time. Old windows are not soundproof, so some rooms can be quite noisy because the air handlers outside are running at full blast 24/7. But my wife liked the rustic furniture and the entire setup. Will come back when we are in SF next time."
25,"As you would suspect, at the price point the room is in need of updating.  This did not bother me at all, I would definitely stay at this hotel again when traveling solo.  I would probably choose another hotel if I was traveling with a significant other."
26,Breakfast
27,Breakfast was boring. Just same pastries & cold croissants. No coffee & tea maker in the room.
28,Would like tea/coffee making facility in room.
29,Room is a bit old so the floor lining starts to come off. Sound proof is not so good. Breakfast is poor.
30,Small room
31,I liked the Colonial decor but in places it looked tired. New paint might give it a lift.
32,It’s old and breakfast is poor
33,"The room would benefit from some renovation! The small bathroom is in working conditions but shows its age, as does the room (e.g. the ancient sash window). But this did not disturb us."
34,"Room was super small , the heater was loud and we must have been by a utility closet or something."
35,Smells weird and breakfast is very limited
36,Lobby and bathrooms need updating. Breakfast was weak.
37,The lack of variety in the breakfast offered
38,Room and bathroom way too small
39,"The furniture was very dated. When people were smoking downstairs, it came up through our bathroom windows which was rather unpleasant. The electrical sockets were dangerous - both in our room and public areas of the hotel. Many weren’t properly affixed to the walls, some had tape to hold them in place. Disappointing that I had to go downstairs wet, to ask for a hairdryer. Also, a pity the bar wasn’t open before 5pm because we would have spent more money there!"
40,"It’s very noisy, you can hear everything outside the window and even more through the walls, sometimes it sounded as if our neighbours were in our room"
41,The Valet Parking was a treat but way too expensive.  It really was almost a third of the cost of the actual room!
42,Other tan chem in nothing
43,"The rooms don't have air conditioned, and not much clarity"
44,"Réception staff and waiter/bell boy at the breakfast room very rude. Very poor breakfast. Very plastic. Asking about fruits said... ""Tomorrow again fruits. Today finished"" and it was 8.30, breakfast ends at 10.00!!!  Asking about lemon for the tea... No lemons!!!
The room has a smell. Wifi... Up and down"
45,The place needs a serious renovation. Some power plugs in the room not working. Very basic breakfast.
46,"Decor was a bit tired, the hotel looked better in the photos"
47,"Very outdated, need hot breakfast options, new carpet, more outlets."
48,🛌 very old .. It needs a renovation right away. But very good located
49,"Unfortunately, and no fault of the Hotel, but this area is riddled with homeless people, some of who are quite aggressive and frightening.  Definitely not safe to wander back from a restaurant in the evening, even for two people.  I would not stay in the area again. Reception/check in staff were not friendly.No air-conditioning so had to open window for fresh air.  Street noise very loud so purchased ear buds."
50,Breakfast was a bit basic
51,The breakfast was VERY VERY basic and not what was expected.  The staff - if you could find them - did not seem to care about presentation.  The tables were not cleaned and the bins overflowing.
52,Some of the staff's attitude left a bit to be desired and they didn't appear to have been trained in public relations.   Others were helpful.
53,"Room was stuffy, breakfast was a bowl of cheerios and a muffin. Breakfast should have more variety. Beds uncomfortable"
54,Not sure of area for walking... probably went the wrong way ..away from union square which would have been safer
55,Breakfast menu is very limited only cereals and muffins with coffee no egg station or fresh fruits etc
56,"No savoury food a breakfastNo kettle in room option"
57,"No air con but do have huge fans.
It's s bit dated and old but it adds to the charm"
58,"There was one really rude, nasty desk person who seemed to have been at the desk most mornings (tall, thin man in his late 30's early 40's). When I would ask for advice he would refuse. Once I had problem with my Muni app (I didn't know how it worked) and he refused to help me. Outright refused. Luckily another guest came along and helped explain everything to me.Also my mattress was lumpy, perhaps it just need to be flipped but there was an indentation on one side."
59,"No a/c, however it was not needed while I stayed there, fortunately"
60,The customer care is just about good.
61,Shower was poor.
62,no hair dryer in the room had to get it from reception
63,"Breakfast was continental but I would have least expected toast, only a croissant or muffin was offered and I could not eat the cereal as I am lactose intolerant. There is no cooling, so I would not stay here in the summer."
64,Room near a wind vent being a bit noisy at night.
65,"The breakfast need to be improved , no even eggs no cheese"
66,"My window was broken, so I couldn't open it, and for the price it wasn't quite what I was expecting. I would stay again though, since no other hotel offered a rate I could afford!"
67,"Not very much choice at breakfast - no juice other than orange. Pub food was good, but not very extensive menu. I would have liked more sandwiches/snacks"
68,Breakfast ! Was basic
69,"No Air conditioning, The matress needs to be replaced. It was like sleeping in a gully or sink hole."
70,Parking is valet and $42 per night.
71,place slightly dated
72,Valet parking was 45 dollars a night but wasn't mentioned until we arrived. There's nowhere to park so you feel inclined to take it.
73,The breakfast was disappointing.
74,N/A
75,rooms were a little musty smelling but I just chalked it up to being an old building.
76,The room had an odor...I think it was coming from the mini fridge. No screen on window....facing noisy alley. The free breakfast all carbs. Would’ve liked some yogurt and fruit.
77,Bathroom needs updating!
78,"I wish there would have been more fruit options for breakfast, but you still had pastries and cereal."
79,"Hotel was beautiful, room was not very well ventilated and SF runs warm this time of year. The room did have standing fan but did not circulate. Slept with window wide open just no breeze to help us out."
80,No AC
81,"No TV, no hair dryer.  Small room, view only of roofs & walls of other bldgs."
82,"The room was hot and stuffy, and being right next to the elevator meant we could hear everytime someone went up or down."
83,Communal areas /carpets were dated
84,"No kettle in room 
pillows need to be changed"
85,Tea and coffee facilities in the room would have been good
86,"No a/c on a hot night, but box fan was great with open windows. Bathroom was dated, but worked fine."
87,Second day breakfast no fruit
88,"Very jaded and in need of some renovations 
Unless you got up at crack of dawn hardly any breakfast left"
89,"Breakfast decidedly ordinary. Limited selection and failure to replenish on our first occasion, although after mentioning to reception replenishment improved, but selection did not. Not everyone wants croissants or muffins for breakfast.Tv in rooms but rubbish picture. Waste of time watching it. No coffee machines in room even though there is a fridge. Staff were no able to provide an electric kettle for the rooms. Our first accommodation on the trip where this occurred.Concierge was a little aggressive in demanding tip."
90,The room was a little smaller than we expected and not air conditioned but there was a fan
91,The location could have been a little bit closer to powell st and market st
92,"Breakfast should be provided with bread, ham and cheese."
93,"It was warm and had to prop the window open with the ice bucket. They should serve coffee prior to the breakfast which starts at 7am. I'm an early riser and had to walk down the block to 7-11 to get a cup for us."
94,The room was a bit small for a family of adults and very warm.
95,Staff
96,"Parking was horrifically expensive for the night, so we instead parked on the street where we were warned cars are often broken into (fortunately, ours was fine). Also, all the staff at the front desk were somewhat rude and unhelpful, but nothing too terrible."
97,"Reception was a bit rundown, needs an update."
98,"Male attitude on reception 
Breakfast tray and coffee containers slow to be replaced"
99,In general the hotel met the expectations. The building is a little bit old and need some renovations in rooms.
100,"No ac, too hot, no window in the bathroom that can be fully closed, loud in the morning"
101,"Breakfast, mattress"
102,Breakfast had no variety. No hairdryer in room.
103,Breakfast too scarce
104,Could have had less sweet food for breakfast and more variety of cereal. A few less drinks in the fridge and an updated price list would have been helpful
105,Small space
106,"The elevator is hilarious. It's only a 7 story building, so feel free to take the stairs at either end of the hallway. That poor elevator is so over used (not in bad shape) that it's hard to get a lift when you want one. Be ready to wait & get close with your fellow occupants :)"
107,"Hallways could use a bit of updating, room was nicer"
108,Air conditioning would have been nice.
109,"Breakfast is anemic, needs any sort of protein:  yogurt, eggs, etc.  mostly just cereal and bread with a small bit of fruit."
110,"Control room temp. Size of bathroom, esp. shower"
111,"No air conditioner, rooms hot."
112,Looks a little tired in places. The English pub where breakfast is served is rather dark so not very inviting. As with all San Francisco hotels it was overpriced especially £ v $ !!!
113,The continental breakfast was very average but there was an amazing diner around the corner.
114,A/c would have been nice for cooling and to block out street noise.
115,Accommodation a little dated and breakfast very basic.
116,No air conditioning in the room and so the window needs to be left open for fresh air which then lets the noise in from the street. Beds were acceptable but not overly comfortable.
117,No air conditioner in room sealed windows and no balcony
118,"no air conditioner , room next to elevator"
119,"It’s not the standard quality you’d normally expect for the price you’re paying, but it’s due to its location in San Fran. Saying that, we had no problems when we stayed there for the 5 nights. Only small things I would recommend is to have the hair dryer in the room rather than having to collect it in reception and to have a price list available for the mini bar in the room."
120,No way to adjust room temperature we froze
121,There is no AC.  There was road construction all night and our window had to be open for ventilation. It was miserable. A window air conditioner would’ve been amazing!
122,For $400 I wasn't expecting paper bowls for my cereal
123,The room is nearby the elevator so we can hear noise of the elevator at night.
124,Room kinda small as well as bathroom— needs a little update.
125,"Initially checked into a room that hasn’t been cleaned and reception didn’t seem to care but another member of staff sorted things quickly. 
Elevator is very noisy all night but there is a fan in the room which I used to drown the noise out so slept well."
126,"We were in room 211 , a designated smoker's room so we found out by slight tobacco smell but this cleared up by the next day. Below this room is the bar with a noisy wooden games table that got used a couple of nights out of our 5 nights stay. There was a strange cleaning agent smell in the air that smelt like a run down old people's home.The breakfast isn't continental , its cereal & Danish pastries all on plastic disposal plates.The TV picture was grainy. Sounds a lot to moan about but we were there for 5 nights out earlyish in the morning & back @ 9 at night for a drink at the bar & the bar noise didn't happen until a couple of nights in to our stay by then couldn't be bothered to ask to move rooms."
127,"I had forgotten about the street life in SF. That’s quite jarring. To be fair, that’s a problem for all properties in SF.More specific to the property, I’D say it shows it’s age but it also has “personality” that your standard mega corporation hotel does not have. That’s the trade-off."
128,Very noisy room
129,The staff was kind of rude.
130,"the breakfast could have been better, but it was easy access and ok as far as that goes."
131,"The Windows had no screens, so opening them allowed noise from outside ventilation systems to come in. More attention to detail would have been helpful in terms of peeling paint and cracked wallpaper."
132,"Being advised not to walk the streets after dark, not so much to do with the area but just the downside of citylife.  So get picked up and dropped off at the hotel door should you have evening events to attend."
133,"The breakfast was really poor. Not good selection to choose  from. Some of the items were stale.
Told check out was at 12pm. Cleaner tried to come in twice before 12 while we were getting ready. When existing the room a member of staff looked at us and commented to another staff member 'yes they're leaving'. Said it to the staff at the front desk and didn't seem to believe it or be too bothered."
134,Breakfast was minimal
135,Undesirable smell by the elevator.
136,"The continental breakfast was subpar. There wasn’t even water available & no staff around to assist. I’ve had better inclusive breakfasts at hostels. Also could have used extra blankets and a hair dryer...,"
137,"Bed was uncomfortable, there was no fan or A/C it was very hot. Food for breakfast was basic and one day they ran out and not much left."
138,amenity
139,"Room 316 (on the building corner) looked onto two huge a/c units on the adjacent buildings, consequently the room was NEVER quiet. We were offered an alternative, but that was on the 6th floor & smaller & hotter."
140,"No aircon, too much furniture for room size, quite dated , bedroom sound from next room ."
141,"Breakfast could be a little better. Waffles or eggs, potatoes or sausage"
142,Very dark
143,There is no air conditioning in the building and it was a bit stuffy in the room. They did have fans in the room.
144,It was extremely hot and my room was very stuffy. The breakfast wasn't much for me because I eat gluten free and could only eat a few grapes one day and a banana the next. They should add oatmeal at least.
145,No air conditioning. Room was stiflingly hot. Automatically charged my credit card when I wanted to pay cash.
146,No air conditioning
147,Night staff were quite unhelpful and bordered on being rude at times. Everything appeared to be too much trouble for them i.e. supplying hot water for cups of tea (as there were no kettles in rooms) likewise for hair dryers!! Day staff were the complete opposite- very helpful and cheery.
148,No tea and coffee making facillity in the room.  No air conditioning and heating very old system of radiator ( water) controlled by hotel staff .  No phone to contact front desk in the room. Room cold so bit cumbersome having to keep going downstairs to request heating to be turned on and to ask for hot water to make a cup of tea. Building old and large gaps in sash windows making room draughty.
149,Nothing.
150,A microwave in the room would be useful.
151,Over priced and no air conditioning in the room
152,"Electric outlets, USB, and flat TV need to updated"
153,"No AC smelled very musty. We left our I Phone in the room . Very funny that the maids could not find it. I don’t like thieves and liars!!!!"
154,Beds were too small !  It got too hot in the room because the heating system runs thru the whole building whit no way to adjust it in your room.... I don't know why it was even on because the temp was 58 - 60 at night and a blanket would suffice.  But... overall it was a nice stay..!
155,A bit worn in spots
156,The so called continental breakfast just consists of muffins and some cereal.
157,"Unfriendly reception, rude even.Breakfast only sweet stuff, no bread, no yogurt. We only took coffee and juice."
158,"The elevator beside the room .. room was clean .. some stains on carpet. But i bet they were there along time so would be tough to remove.. No A/C , the fan had trouble keeping up .. so might get a little warm in the summer months but if the windows open San Francisco has a breeze will take care if that problem"
159,Long wait for elevator. We ended up just taking the stairs to the 6th level because another couple got in with all the luggage.
160,Not enough blankets or pillows
161,Alley way of the 6th floor smells pee.
162,The check in staff was not very friendly
163,Rooms need maintenance blind was broken and had been for awhile
164,"1.If Queen room only corner rooms. Rest is too small2. Almost all rooms suffer fm Airstream noise. Check before U pay3. Don’t bother hopeless guys at reception. They are probably lonely guys! But annoying"
165,The top window was slightly ajar and I couldn’t get it closed to lock. Exhaust vent or air conditioner was outside the bathroom and I could hear this whirring when bathroom door was open
166,Our room was very warm. The radiator was on full and we could not turn it off. We asked 4 times for our heating to be turned off in our room and each time the person agreed but it was on again shortly after that. It appears the heating is centrally controlled and is either on or off. One night when I called down saying I couldn’t sleep because it was so hot I was told that there were people in the hotel freezing and to open my window (which was already open).
167,The bathrooms too small /:
168,Breakfast was a little chaotic.
169,Room smelled like sweat
170,"Noisy plumbing from above and besideNoise from adjacent lift"
171,NO AC. The bed was pretty uncomfortable.
172,"Guests raid the Breakfast offerings heavily, so do not arrive too late"
173,Shower didn't have hot water and little water pressure
174,The hotel has no air conditioning. Luckily the weather was chilly and we were able to open the windows of the hotel
175,"No control over temperature in room.   Most continental breakfast includes eggs or waffles, breakfast could have better selection."
176,Everything was okay
177,Breakfast provided was minimal
178,Noisy fridge
179,Rooms are out dated. Water damage by shower. Have to walk a couple blocks to bring dog grassy area for bathroom. Staff did not know of anyplace to bring dog for bathroom.
180,The hotel was great but we were right by the elevator so it was a bit noisy. If you are picky about temperature you do not have control over the room temperature. It was a little hot for me so we had to open the window which I. the middle of SF can be pretty noisy (bring earplugs)
181,"The room was small with tight quarters. There was too much furniture. It was stuffy without airflow; with only a plug-in fan in the closet of the room. It was noisy with structure noise, water running, and random noises throughout the night, coming from unknown areas in hotel."
182,"Rooms are a bit tired. My sport coats smelled of the paint from the closet - that was a real bummer and was not happy. The ""free"" continental breakfast was better than nothing but, hardly inspiring. Thankfully, lots of cheap places for breakfast are close by."
183,The breakfast selection was sparse. There was no desk for working in the room. I had indicated business travel so I clearly expected booking.com to suggest options that would enable working while traveling.
184,Love vintage so love this hotel. My favorite is the staff & cleanliness. Overall I love everything about it. Having breakfast in the Whitehorse is an added pleasure.
185,Food served for breakfast
186,Attitude of staff. Seemed disinterested. Unfriendly and not helpful
187,More transparent when it comes to forms of payment.
188,There was nothing we didn't like
189,"Bathroom!  No place for soap or shampoo. Then, hot water was very iffy. My shower was quite the disaster."
190,"The check-in experience was hugely disappointing, early check-in was shut down swiftly and I was made to wait and then rudely ignored by the handover staff. The staff were hugely rude and ignored my requests. The staff had an aura of entitlement that was really odd for a hotel."
191,The hotel is getting tired and could do with a renovation and our room was not cleaned properly every day - dust on the surfaces.
192,"Rental Car not recommended, parking is expensive."
193,Continental breakfast is very minimal.
194,Room had a smell
195,The room was very small without any view.
196,The receptionist was very helpful in provide parking information and other recommendations for the sightseeing of the city.
197,"We were told the continental breakfast hours were from 7am-10:30am. We came down at 10:15 and they were mostly done cleaning up the room. When we asked about it, they said no it didn't go until 10:30. Normally I would expect them to offer something since they had just put stuff away, but they would't even get us a coffee cup even though the carafes were still out. It was really disappointing. We also went to the White Horse Bar the evening before, which is open until 2:00am. We had just sat down to drink a couple beers we ordered and a rude woman came over to us at 1:30am and said you will need to leave. You can take the drinks up to your room. While I had high hopes when we first checked in and the staff was so friendly. These two experiences left a bad taste."
198,"Tiny version of continental Breakfast. - you expect more.
No aircondition - bad air on the room"
199,"Price could have been lower, but overall the hotel met my expectations"
200,"The bed sinks in the middle and is generally quite uncomfortable 
Very noisy sounds at night, heater probably, but also tapping. Being a bit of scaredycat it wasn’t good for my sleep"
201,Room was a little “tired” with paint peeling off the heater.  No tea/ coffee making facilities in room.
202,Nothing to be done on this but stayed there for 2 weeks and the tiny room was not very comfortable after a while.
203,"Breakfast variety not muchNo toothbrush/toothpaste provided"
204,Staff unhelpful and not very friendly
205,The service and the staff were professional. The location was close to Union square. I would stay there again. The breakfast was good.
206,Bad noise from heater at 7th floor
207,Heating is very poor
208,"My room was definitely shabby.  The television/refrigerator table was pretty beat up.  It was particle board with veneer and the veneer had been scraped off along the bottom... it looked like it was rescued from the side of the road after falling off truck and getting hit a couple of times.  Generally, rundown.  Really needs a refresh.  No desk or place to work in the room that I had, but friends staying at the same hotel did have a desk.  I had to work in the sitting area downstairs near the entrance to the Tavern.   No place to plug in a computer in the room.  Had to recharge in the bathroom and unplug lamps and clock radio to work on the computer."
209,Reception was very rude
210,"Staff were not exactly helpful nor friendly... Breakfast was basic continental - mini croissants, jelly, fruit and cereal. No hot breakfast items."
211,"The bathroom in particular was a bit tired but it did the job and the 'view' from our window was mostly the heating system (I think).  The blind fell down the first time we used it but it was easy to re-hook back in place.  We ordered a taxi to take us to the airport on the day we left and paid a deposit, unfortunately it didn't turn up and there was no record of it being booked.  Fortunately, we were Uber registered so called that and got a refund for our taxi deposit.  We probably should have checked the day before but didn't."
212,"Brakefast Missed hot meal Like eggs bacon pancakes All usual in a so called brakefast whe is offered Otherwise you must have said Coffee and some pastries or so."
213,The unscheduled nightly charge. If a local tax or charge is necesssary this should be indicated in booking.com pricing
214,Was assigned room near the elevator which is very noisy.
215,Bfast. They need a few toasters and sliced bread. And proper tables.
216,Shower could not be regulated. Either too hot or cold. Gave up after 30 minutes and had to use wash cloth.
217,"Breakfast is VERY basic, especially if you have any gluten issues; it was carbohydrate heaven. The only thing I could eat there were grapes & a banana. The hot water for tea had been stored in a container that at some point, had coffee in it. It’s a smell & flavor you cannot get out, so your tea ends up tasting like coffee-tea, pretty gross. Pillows on the bed - terrible"
218,No door for the bathroom. My sister and I had no privacy from each other
219,"room on 3rd floor, windows looking on walls"
220,"Had to get a hair dryer from front desk. Limited number."
221,"Room wasn't that clean. We noticed they never vacuumed the carpet during our 3 night stay. Breakfast was too basic, but that's what you can expect form a hotel of it's category .Valet parking was SO EXPENSIVE! There are many options around."
222,Breakfast choices very vague & parking at lot across the street way too expensive. No parking with room stay
223,We missed dinner because the room attendant took to long to put a battery in the chirping smoke detector. We were discouraged from going to breakfast because right outside our window the kitchen lady was hacking and coughing and they took the pots that were sitting outside all night inside the kitchen. The tv was analog no cable.
224,no hot water flask and complimentary mineral water in the room.
225,The room was nice however the paint on the radiator was chipping badly which was a little freaky and seemed un-clean.
226,Does the hotel have a heater? Cause it was cold in the room.  There was no complimentary bottled water :(
227,Breakfast was a disappointment and the coffee poor
228,Maybe it can be a little more cheaper ?:)
229,I would have liked some heating in the room especially since it is winter in San Francisco
230,"Bed were little narrow.No hair dryer in the room, so I had to ask the front desk and I got one but had to give it back. Not so bad."
231,The room is really small
232,"The attitude of the manager really pissed me off...he is an Asian guy but only smiled to white peoples. When he saw any Asian travelers, he would suddenly changed into a rude and impolite mode. REALLY INAPPROPRIATE"
233,I had to go to  the main floor for ice. And i didn't  know how to work  the heater. And the TV didn't work
234,It was ok.
235,"Breakfast was poor and not environment friendly. Although the room had two ""queen"" beds, it was not comfortable for 2 adults and a 12 year old child. The house keeping was starting cleaning ver early in the morning. The noises from other rooms coupe be heard."
236,"We did not appreciate how the valet suggested us to walk a block away (although close) when we could have walked to begin with in the beginning to the parking garage if that was the case. We would have much preferred to just pay for the parking which was $35 flat rate, instead of $42.75 for valet when in the end we ended up getting the car ourselves. We were only given the option to walk at the end. It would have been nice to be given the option of valet or walking at the beginning. As well as the garage being a block away and the valet telling us its 20-30 minutes away then 40 to grab the car. We felt a bit for granted for our money. We are students and every penny counts."
237,"The bar in the room could be extended with a kettle and some cups, tea,coffee to warm up after a long walk on the cold. It would have been nice, if the staff would have been more welcoming and motivated. I went to the reception to ask a question, no one was behind the counter but a guy sitting on the couch in the lobby. As he noticed I have a question, he yelled across the hall of he could help me, but didn't even bother to get up or look up my details as I asked for a late check out. (His English wasn't the best either, it was quiet heard to understand him) Another time there were two behind the counter. They told me to wait as someone else would help me and continued a conversion in a different language. As no other staff member seem to appear, the lady got up and helped me out (which she could have done straight away)."
238,the reception area is really chaotic and dirty ....
239,Staff
240,Check in staff were stressed and day staff were not that helpful with questions we had about getting about the are
241,The hotel needs some basic upkeep. The toilet flushed after 3/4 times (-a lot of wasted water)   Mold on the bathroom floor and wallpaper peeling. It's sad because we've been staying there for many years and love it!
242,"First room.....bathroom window louvers open....could not be closed so cold air came in....Staff changed room for us in am.....this one had shower that door that leaked on floor when in use."
243,"The rude staff at check in check out - he appeared to be the manager, but had no idea of customer service. The grumpy bar lady - if you don't like your jobs or interacting with people in a civil way I suggest you both get another job where no human interaction is required."
244,"Parking was advertized as onsite, I assumed that guests were free park but that is not the case.  Guestes do not even get a discount.  Be prepared to have the parking fees to be billed by each entity that handles your car; I had to pay the hotel for booking the parking this fee is paid at check out.  You will also have to pay a fee  paid directly to the attendant for the parking garage."
245,the check in....desk chap was stressy and kept getting sidetracked - not what you want after 16+ hours travelling. Getting a taxi was a headache and not 100% reliable...book your self (somehow).
246,Front desk staff was rude and unfriendly.  We asked him a question and he said he was busy eating.  He said we'd have to come back later.  Never encountered this type of response from the front desk.  Not sure about location of this hotel.
247,"They don't have parking, and the parkings near arw very expensive
The breakfast was very simpler"
248,"Breakfast. Super basic.
View to inner court."
249,"Hotel a little dated, but good."
250,"The rooms vary in size and facilities. Some of the larger rooms have only a very narrow window overlooking an alley. The rooms facing Sutter street are small, and the bathrooms are minuscule."
251,Homeless outside woke us up around 4am talking very loud.   We left new sunglasses at the bar & tried to see if someone turned them in but they stated no. Found out later they were exchanged with my receipt at the store I bought them at.
252,"Too soft beds.Only sweets for breakfast"
253,The room was next to the elevator so we could hear it all day and all night
254,"The twin room was very small. We had difficulty opening our suitcases. The radiator was very hot and only about 1 foot away from our heads. Should have booked a bigger room, but I think this was the last one. Breakfast was in the bar next door and was rather basic. Again I suppose what we paid for."
255,"The room had no view, the window looked at the oposit wall 1 meter distance. Internet was not reliable, i even could not arrange my check in for the next day travel.  However as a positive feed-back: the hotel stuff offered to go to their other hotel a few blocks away where i was able to arrange the check in and printing the documents. Parking cost is very high in this location and you need to pay it separately, and need to ask for the price as well as it is not mentioned."
256,My room was directly on the street! Which turned out to be a godsend. I could open my window when people were smoking in a non smoking area...it seeped through the vents.
257,"Breakfast just okay, could have done a better job.Breakfast room ridiculously hot!!Guest room very, very hot. Can’t imagion what it is like in the summer months.Sheets on beds old and pilled, need to be replaced."
258,A bit dated but adequate for what we needed.
259,"- maybe a bit too antique or maybe not that clean in the room- no parking for guests (terrible to find free parking spot there)- bathroom door old and unable to be closed- wouldn't recommend it for a longer stay"
260,NA
261,None
262,It seemed as if a perfume spray was pumped into the room periodically.
263,"No air con, blinds in room faulty so could not sleep as outside light and noise from having to have window open. Breakfast very basic just pastries, cereal and coffee all in plastic cups and paper plates."
264,"Staff was disinterested.My daughter & I walked in with our suitcases and the guy at the desk barely looked up.He muttered ""Checking Out?"" We had just come from the airport after an almost 6 hr flight and were really astonished at his indifference.We replied ""NO,checking IN"",and he rudely said without looking up ""Rooms aren't ready till 3"". We said we had just come from the airport and would just like to leave our bags while we went for something to eat. He then said that maybe he could find us a room that was ready,and so he did.But eye contact and a ""Hello Welcome to the Beresford"" would have been nice.The greeting.or lack of,left a bad first impression on us.That's not how you greet guests,in my way of thinking.The room faced the street and had no screens.It was very warm,so we opened the window,which brought in bugs,flies,I think.There was also a lot of street noise,and we were on the 7th floor.For the price,I think we could have done better elsewhere.The place is very dated and the rooms could use a paint job.But the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was adequate."
265,"Wasn't the best location for children, streets were dirty with feces and vomit. Would not stay here again for this reason."
266,"Our room was right on top of the bar/restaurant, it was EXTREMELY noisy until 2am."
267,"Our room haven’t microwave and hair dryer, can imagine we got cold and didn’t have tool to get hot water to make a tea :( Was sad. Don’t have own parking so you must to pay 42+taxes everyday. I wrote them an email previously to make a reservation asking for it and they simply said: We have parking at rear.  Then my reservation for three nights was from 535 to 730 dollars because of my rent car."
268,Room was very small and too hot with no way to cool down. Walls are thin.
269,Only sweet food available for breakfast
270,The breakfast selection was limited
271,Nothing.
272,No coffee maker in room.  Coffee not available until 7:00 am at breakfast.
273,The shower was not ideal. Inconsistent temperature and a shower head that didn’t spray well. Also it was a bit too low for someone 6’ tall.
274,"Bathroom feels very dated- bath was not full size & was sunk into floor with shower over. Also needed an efficient extractor. My room was on the top floor and there was noise coming from the roof where there were vents. An upgrade to the bathroom would make the room and stay overall much more comfortable."
275,small........For $200 needs to be bigger!
276,Breakfast was very poor.
277,"Not the cleanest (just a couple of blond hairs around and I'm not blond), but was cleaned well each day of my stay. Some streets around the hotel felt a little bit sketchy, but I was safe evan at night."
278,"Coffee could be available earlier (none in room). Business travel requires being up much earlier, and 7:00am is LATE to have coffee available. I had to walk to 711 at 4:45am, and it was full of tweakers, and I was grabbed walking down the street, the area is not bad, but at 5am is spooky walking to get coffee.No help from Bell/valet (and the guy was not 'that' busy) when I was leaving. No eye contact (intentional), made me late. Arrival was the opposite; VERY helpful; this was 5pm on a Monday. The morning staff - not at all helpful at 7:10am and I had much to load in my car. Very stressful."
279,"The reception staff weren't friendly or pleasant, especially the fella who checked us out when we left. Too busy watching a screen, didn't acknowledge us, barely spoke. Never asked us if everything was ok, didn't say goodbye or nothing. No customer service at all behind reception. Hotel old and dated, furniture in room ancient and couldn't open window. No safe in room and wouldn't dream of asking the awful ignorant staff at reception so locked our money and passports in our cases. Bathroom old and the showers were terribly dated, took ages to get temperature right. Ruined a pair of trousers with the iron in the room and i was careful to use the correct setting and the quarter size small ironing board was a total waste of time. The only good thing was the beds were comfortable and we slept well at night. The fella who took our cases to our room when we first checked in was really nice and helpful, the only member of staff in this hotel that was. Definitely wouldn't stay here again!!!!"
280,Bathroom poorly presented with peeling wallpaper and chipped paintwork. Staff surly at best!
281,"THE SO CALLED CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST WAS DISGUSTING.  Bad cold coffee, a bowl of grapes, stale muffins, and croissants. Come on folds, get with the program. How hard would it be to have a decent cereal, some cold cuts, toast, and good coffee. shame on you for calling this breakfast.   The door in the bathroom was not even a door. And the satellite dish was out and we were not told about it. We were there for two days, and the satellite was out the entire time."
282,"No hairdryer provided. However, was able to get one from reception. The breakfast is very poor. Cereal and pastries only, There were grapes on occassion but no other fruit. We ate out most mornings."
283,Breakfast and lumpy pillows
284,Nothing to do with Beresford: my first time in America and I find the tipping system difficult and felt embarrassed because I got it wrong with the housekeepers.
285,price
286,"Too much furniture in the room, super squeaky bed lol"
287,dining room a bit dark and gloomy   bathroom shower  could do  with updating  and  as no  fan or a/con  would  be uncomfortable in hot weather
288,"Parking is an absulute nightmare!!! Save yourself the headache of having your car towed and the $600 bill and pay the hotel 50 bucks for valet. None of the rooms have AC, you can open the windows(no screens) and get a fan from the front desk."
289,I think the mattress was old-didn't seem comfortable. There was no air conditioning in the room. The shower did not work properly-it was very hard to regulate the heat of the water.
290,Stayed near the front part of the hotel facing the main street. Very noise and got woken up early every morning by the loading and unloading trucks at the other side of street.
291,"Small room, but I didn't care much"
292,nothing.
293,Poor tv variety. In room coffee would be nice. No microwave
294,Rooms are a bit tired and can be a little noisy from generators.  Continental breakfast ran out quickly!
295,The beds were small and the bathroom window of my room was broken. Not ideal when it's 15 degrees outside.
296,Guy at reception was grumpy when we asked for directions on our very 1st day
297,Just breakfast when I come and abit late fruit was finish should be refilled Otherwise it was good overall
298,Rude guestd
299,Bed sheets were not clean. They looked like they were not washed.
300,Surprised by the lack of AC but not an issue with 50 to 60 degree days in San Francisco - it is an old property but reasonable maintained and met our expectations
301,"Expensive valet parking. We did not use it, instead we found a parking garage closeby."
302,"Breakfast was as basic as it gets, croissants and muffins out of the box with two types of cereal. Paper/plastic dishes, knifes, and cups - a lot of waste for every breakfast. Room was really small, could hardly open our two suitcases. The shower had a lot of mold stains."
303,"No Air Conditioning, very small room and bath."
304,Furnishing etc were a bit tired and dated but perfectly ok.
305,"A coffeemaker in the room would have been nice, as the hotel did not have coffee ready until 7:00 a.m. and I am an early riser.  The continental breakfast was mostly pastries, so nothing much healthy except some fruit.  A microwave would have been nice also.  There was a mini-fridge, but it was stuffed with for-purchase items.  I'm vegan and always appreciate a place to store some of my own survival food.  The fitness room had just a treadmill (maybe a few other basic cardio machines but I don't recall) and no weights."
306,The breakfast is not good. A few pastries and cereal. Some toast would have been nice.
307,old and tired
308,I didn’t know that the hotel doesn’t have air conditioning.
309,Breakfast was ok/standard.
310,"No concierge, but not expected at the rice.
Not always welcome at reception.
No kettle."
311,"A little noisy at night, but you're in the heart of San Francisco."
312,"Staff was condescending, and lacked empathy for any of the guests I saw them interact with. Put me in a smoking room without asking, and put me in the worst room of the group for which I had made the reservations. Room was drafty and freezing cold, and they did not offer extra blankets when I told them about it."
313,Staff rood. No heater.
314,"Staff is inconsistent.Some are nice, some not very nice and condescending. Management most likely knows who they are.Not looking for fluff, just basic cordiality.Rooms are basic. Clean. Ok for a quick stay"
315,"It's not my favorite type of breakfast, but coffee and pastries were good."
316,It needs to be remodeled. The room looked worn and dirty.
317,if breakfast was available earlier
318,"Some bureaucratic rigidity.  My stay was made of several successive reservations of the same room (as is often the case for reservation made far in advance, in order to anticipate plan change - more than 1 year in advance for this professional trip).It was not possible to make one ""global check-in"" for the whole stay.  As a result, I had to come many times at the reception for re-checking, and re-checking out.This practice - thought totally legal - is of course annoying, and rarely seen in practice (I have never experienced the case yet during my numerous hotel stays, including previously at Beresford).Hence staying at another hotel is a better choice if you need this type of flexibility (there are plenty of hotels in the area at similar prices)."
319,TV was very poor. No enthusiasm  from staff.
320,No hairdryer in room had to get from reception
321,N/A
322,The weather
323,NA
324,"Checked in on Friday night 1/31. Had a hard time connecting to Wi Fi in lobby as I hadn’t checked in yet! Front desk clerk was very curt and insistent that she see the whole booking even though I told her I couldn’t connect!Said a booking confirmation number was not sufficient!Had to walk a block to get reception and come back to check in!Really??"
325,"No coffee in the room, but not big deal."
326,Everything ok
327,Nothing.
328,"It was a little run down. Needs some new bedding, carpet, paint. Pub was dark and dusty. Just needs a little face-lift. Family owned and they were lovely people. Very helpful and pleasant."
329,"The bed wasn't particularly comfortable, nor was it terrible. No good beer in the minibar."
330,Rooms need updating
331,"This hotel is really old and it shows in all aspects. The one small window when opened up even a crack, let's in the smell of raw sewage at night and then some sort cleaning fluid scent that was overwhelming. Not much to say that's positive other than it's close to Union Square."
332,The facilities of the hotel were old and needed some upkeep. The room was very stuffy. There was no windows to let in fresh air. The bed & pillows were super uncomfortable. The staff were not very helpful.
333,Had a window that could not be closed completely.  You can't control the heat in your room.  Onsite restaurant has limited menu.
334,"A fee things:
1) the bed was very uncomfortable
2) they did not have a hairdryer
3) the TV signal was very bad
4) poor ventilation
5) breakfast was just appalling in a poorly-lit room
6) the shuttle bus they booked me on was driven by a very rude man. It was the most horrific experience of my life to get back to the airport"
335,The staff attitude is very bad
336,"Our bathroom door was a little sticky, but we just let them know. No biggie."
337,No elevator. Very expensive. People at the reception were not very kind
338,"Needs renovation, no desk in my room."
339,Elevator did not work
340,The property is on the national registry of historic buildings. As you might imagine some of the facilities are quite fatigued.
341,Breakfast could have bread/bagels rather than just sweet options. Eggs would be amazing..
342,"Well, where to begin? The check-in experience was awful. Older woman at front desk tried to shush me on arrival, she was clearly struggling to login to the computer system and was quite rude to me. My plane had been delayed and I had to be somewhere in SF- I did not appreciate being ignored and treated as an inconvenience. She did not want to even acknowledge me. When she finally did she sent me to a room with a faulty smoke alarm which kept beeping every 3 minutes, directly above a very noisy air con unit. ( I don't smoke) She would not move me to another room. Worker /busboy ?? wanted initially to rip smoke alarm unit off ceiling until I mentioned danger of doing this, then he begrudgingly changed battery. Both scowled at me continuously during rest of stay. Really not a good hotel, staff primarily ignore customers. I saw similar disdainful treatment of other guests. Stay elsewhere if you can . Pls note- I have never before written a negative review like this but this place really took the cake in terms of rudeness and lack of care."
343,The breakfast was very limited would have like some protein. They ran out of coffee.
344,Rooms are small but doable
345,"Very old hotel, needs renovation. Lack of variety on breakfast"
346,The room was tiny. Was supposed to be a queen room. The bed was even smaller. The window faced a brick wall so was completely dark in the room. And the bathroom had a sliding door. Which was so noisy it was impossible not to use it at night without waking everyone up.
347,"No aircon, so really hard in hot days. Limited breakfast items"
348,Way overpriced
349,The noise. They placed me on the first floor in the first room in the hallway so that should be factored into the review as perhaps other rooms on other floors were better.. I'll never know. However it seems as if the room or maintenance room above was making noise all night. As if there were washing machines going. I heard the whistle of water through the pipes off and on from 12am to 630am to where I stopped trying to sleep...
350,The hotel room was very small and the breakfast was not good. It is a very old hotel with a very small bsthroom
351,Will manage
352,Breakfast and breakfast room
353,"Just one thing in the shower it was very hard to adjust the hot water and cold, either was to hot or to cold, the hotel need to take care of that problem, which i will let them know in the front desk."
354,"Our room was tiny. Do not always believe pictures. The room had this terrible stink to it. The water to shower was cold. My family and I basically took cold showers. We would get hot water for one minute max and then it’d be freezing cold. It was terrible. Let the front desk know but they didn’t seem to care. There were no microwaves in the room so if you go to dinner and take back leftovers to your room to heat up later, forget about it. This hotel is way overpriced for what you get. Never again"
355,Everything but most the office people
356,"Valet service is horrible. No AC in room just an open window with no screen. One of the wash cloths had hair all over it. Tv reception is horrible at best, all 8 channels were blurry"
357,No air con. Get down for breakfast early to get a seat
358,"Beds are uncomfortableNo air conditioning - it was 38 degrees CelsiusBreakfast was free but pretty disappointing choices. Hope you only like grape jam Rooms are very noisy"
359,"Service at front desk Rooms felt unclean Smelly was off putting"
360,The room was very hot no AC and a fan so loud I couldn't sleep with it on. Water damage and mildew in bathroom.
361,"Rooms were extremely Hot and Stuffy, as there was no a/c or fans, when we opened the window for air, the street noise kept us awake. The plumbing was terrible.Rooms very small. Beds comfortable but small."
362,Old and musty.  No air conditioning.
363,"Our room was right next to the elevator. I was a bit worried about it, but it did not cause a problem. No air conditioning, but the available fan was adequate. A BR sink counter would be helpful. I did not see a hair dryer. But I had my own"
364,"Bad smell in the room, no air conditioning, no hairdriyer,  no electorical outlet besides bath room. I wii never come back."
365,"Old facility with smell, not sure the sheet has been changed or not since it is really hard to tell."
366,"Check-in person was bordering on rude... very much felt like staying at a backpackers.  When I asked about where breakfast was, he advised me to ask again in the morning when I would need it!  rather than just pointing me to the visible door where you go through and saying in the bar next door.  Didn't like that there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms... quite disappointing.No real tourist information at front desk, e.g. a map of the area."
367,"No AC, quite warm in room. Opened window on 5th floor but it had no screen. Bathroom had  quite a bit of hair on floor. Loud neighbors and could hear everything."
368,Small room
369,"Room was hot, fan was insufficient and for cooling"
370,Asked for a queen and got a double and a single
371,"Everything was great about our stay, we have no real complaints. Sometimes it was a little noisy but that’s just street noise"
372,"Due to busy road, valet  parking was a challenge"
373,Hot breakfast would have been super!
374,The constant noise outside when window was open -  like an air-conditioner going all the time when there was no A/C in the room.
375,"The only thing I didn’t love was the size of the room and bathrooms, they were a bit small, but if you’re reasonable it should be fine. Well, we (me and my daughter) loved it!!! We so recommend this hotel. And next time we travel to San Francisco, we will stay there!!!"
376,Staff was not friendly at all. The room seeemd very old and did not have AC
377,Choice at breakfast was extremely limited and often items were completely gone by 9am.
378,Wish we had known about the valet parking before we arrived.
379,Little bit of noise in the early part of the night from bar and the street. But each night got quiet after around midnight. Breakfast a bit basic.
380,"The parking, the facilities, the breakfast, the lack of air conditioner, the gym"
381,Lift to 7th floor slow andunreliable
382,Hotel is quite grotty and my room smelled of smoke
383,The valet service was too costly
384,"Weed smell and smokers everywhere inside the hotel including staff. If you complain they do nothing. Outdated, molt spots in the bathroom, no ac, shower pressure problems between hot and cold water."
385,Having to pay $43 to park my car
386,"Everything's very basic, just about adequate. Dirty bedroom window, with view of wall opposite."
387,"Very poor breakfast, smelly and dark breakfast room, unfriendly reception staff"
388,"“Continental breakfast” was literally muffins with coffee or juice. Luckily, Starbucks & mc Donald’s we’re right down the street. I was there for 5 days & not once did I have “breakfast” at the hotel."
389,"Serious comfort and safety issue with first room.Staff had poor attitude.Housekeeper enter our room with do not disturb sign on and us in the room."
390,Nothing
391,Nothing.
392,"The toilet didn’t flush properly, no air conditioning, freezer in refrigerator didn’t work, and I didn’t feel safe in the neighborhood."
393,"I'm tall- 6'6"", beds short. Too bad for me.
Continental breakfast ran out too early.
There was no info packet in the room, no menu for the restaurant, no costs of items in honor bar, and no cool info about the hotel. It is cool."
394,"Would like a little more selection for breakfast but what was provided was of good quality, nice coffee"
395,Smallest hotel room Ive ever seen.
396,"The rooms were very small. The hotel was dated - , no coffee in room, and no air conditioning"
397,One lady on reception was extremely passive aggressive. Very rude to people checking in. Very pass remarkable about other employees.
398,Very outdated ... bathroom very below satisfactory... water pressure low intermittent hot water .. musty
399,"Continental breakfast ran out before the end of breakfast hour, however, it was the same weekend as the Bay to Breaker Race and the hotel was packed."
400,"Hotel is very historically old, rooms reflect the age and the entire hotel feels like it’s from the 1960s.  No air conditioning but there are dirty and dust covered fans available in the room.  The floor slopes greatly and the bathroom is really quite scary.  The bed is super bouncy in a bad way.  Bathroom fixtures were literally falling off the wall and the shower water controls made absolutely no sense whatsoever.  This is a dirty, old, rundown hotel that survives on its relatively low price for the area."
401,beds could be newer
402,"I wouldn't say I did not like it, but for some who are seeking creature comforts, this might matter.  I assume that because it is an older facility, there is no air conditioning.  However, each room has a fan and San Fran is usually very cool.  We placed our fan in the window and it provided a cool breeze and ""white"" noise which made sleeping so comfortable."
403,"The rolls/muffins available for breakfast were hard.  When additional rolls/muffins were brought out, they were much better.  Maybe the staff is trying to save money by bringing out day old ones(?)  The eating area is dark and does not look  very clean.  Couches probably have never been cleaned.   Really looking more like a 2 star place than a 3 star, which is too bad because we have been coming here for a long time. As for communication with staff, very unfriendly over the phone.  In person they were fine."
404,"There was no AC and no screens on the windows, however with e temps near record hi’s it still was not a concern since there was a breeze and no humidity.Rooms are small so it encourages us to stay organized.Window in bath/showered had levelor broken and was covered w a towel, but it faced another windowless building so it was not concerning for privacy.Breakfast was a bit sugary for our taste.We do not eat danish so cold cereal had low fat milk options and it was welcomed.Many options for beverages was fine"
405,"The room was small
No air conditioning and it was bloody hot box room
Shower went hot and cold"
406,The air conditioning
407,"They couldn't find the booking.  Not sure if this was booking.com or the hotel that failed.   Lighting in room is terrible. The breakfast was awful, and the breakfast room is a filthy pub."
408,"Breakfast was poor. Always the same selection: dry croissants, muffins, cornflakes, milk and coffee. 
In addition please get rid of the paper and plastic dishes/cutlery - so much waste and I even think it's more expensive. But that's the only bad thing! 
P.s. ""Fitness room"" has only treadmills and steppers (3)"
409,No air conditioning in room and it was extremely hot. Bathroom door needs attention as we had trouble opening and shutting it.
410,"Room was small, bathroom not much bigger than a refrigerator"
411,TV wouldn't turn on
412,"The staff was rude with us, the receptionist didn't want to tell us nothing about parking lot, we couldn't leave the baggages in reception for five minutes while we parked the vehicle. We drove since LA and we were very tired and the girl in reception had very aggressive answers all the time. It was necessary to pay $100 extra for taxes ($50 by night)  that had not been announced previously anywhere, it was too expensive. The breakfast was basically coffee, orange juice, croissants and muffins."
413,"The staff, the room and the breakfast. All of the above, highly overrated"
414,I had hoped there would be eggs and?or meat of some kind for breakfast as I normally do not eat bread or sweets.
415,Everything was dark brown.
416,Great value for the money
417,Very old poorely mantained hotel. Very old facitilities. Noisy rooms.
418,"The room we had desperately needed a complete renovation (carpets curtains bedspreads etc) The room was very small, Everything was very old & musty, and the bathroom was very small and the shower was disgusting.  You helped yourself to a continental Breakfast using paper cups, plates and bowls in a dark dimly lit pub adjoining the hotel. There was no air conditioning or fans and poor lighting in the room."
419,Not a thing.
420,"The smell in the hallways, the breakfast was very limited and served in a room that is a pub in the evening. Only plastic cutlery, plates and cups available. The window of our room was badly isolated. Non-fx related discrepancies in the final amount to pay."
421,The front desk staff was very rude and the hotel is very old and stinks
422,TV didn't work good. Fuzzy
423,They should serve water at breakfast and multiple types of fruit instead of just one.
424,"Poor customer service, rude and super dry receptionist Very noisy and freezing room!Fair in cleanliness Overall not satisfied with the hotelWould not recommend to anyone"
425,The entire hotel was outdated nothing like the pictures online and smelled like marijuana throughout the entire hotel. No parking available only valet for a high price no other options
426,"Poor customer service, we asked for toothpaste crib the counter which was never delivered to the room during the whole stay. Had to approach the chamber maid when she was cleaning up the room next door."
427,I wish it could have been closer to the nearest BART and Muni stop
428,"Old worn bed. Shower stall had a louvered vent open to outside.  Made for old showers.Couldn’t control heat in the room."
429,"Love that it is right in the middle of everything we were there for.  Near shopping, the Cable Car, and restaurants.  Staff was very helpful, quiet at night in the halls.."
430,"On booking this hotel is sold as not smoking hotel. Actually you can smoke in the room.
I have ashmatic problem.This was a big problem for me.(sometimes people reviews are not enough because they have not idea what a minimum standard is...how can they rate this hotel 3/4/5 stars?)
Terrible breakfast served in the sketchy pub beside the hotel(you can access directly from the hotel)
Terrible room ,old and bad smell.
The cleanliness has very low standard
We decided anyways to skip the room cleaning service the first day as ""green"" choice. The day after we asked instead to make up the room. They just made the bed.
Period.the """"""bathroom"""""" was not even touched.
The window in the room makes the cold come in quickly.it is not properly sealed, you can hear air.coking in while you are in the bed.
The bathroom has a ""window/not window"" that is worse that the one in the room. So pretty much you have a shower with cold air coming on your side.
THERE IS NOT A VENTILATION SYSTEM IN THE ROOM.
The heater situation is another huge problem.
You have to call the front desk to switch the """"magic button"" from downstairs in order for you to turn on, in the room, the heater..very small heater, that in 20-45 minutes, will do it's job.
The lady at the from desk took so so so so long to explain to a couple in front of us about their tour for the day after. And we waited 30inutes to be checked in. She didn't care. She didn't apologize. She never gave us information about heater,things, breakfast. She asked a document, credit card. Done.
The entire team was pretty much rude on the phone every time we call at the desk to turn on the heater."
431,No complaints
432,Nonething
433,"There was a large compressor outside our bathroom window that kept running, sounded like an air conditioner running. But, I survived it!!"
434,"When we opened the door to the room, it would not open completely as it opened into the bed, stopping it short.  The rooms are quite small and we couldn’t locate a thermostat.  The room became quite stuffy as a result.  Parking at the hotel overnight costs us an additional $40."
435,"THE room, and staff"
436,"I saw photos of the hotel before booking and was concerned about the quality of the hotel. Yes, the furniture it old and shabby and the radiator in the bedroom has many layers of peeling paint. Just ignore this and appreciate a well valued hotel."
437,"Very small rooms,direct acces from bathroom to outside making it very cold and noisy,bathroom door didnt stay shut. One small elevator can  get congested on peak hours. The only option if you have a big big as the staircase is very small."
438,"The staff was incredibly rude at check in, the wall were very thin and other occupants loud, the furniture looks like it was chewed up by a dog, sheets were itchy, no way to change room temperature, the shower is either boiling hot or freezing, bathroom walls peeling, and the bathroom light could be seizure inducing.The lowest score this sight will let me post is 2.5, honestly the location is much closer to a 2."
439,"I found management were quiet rude and abrupt which was extremely off putting and we just felt like a burden asking for anything.
The floor level we stayed on had a strange odour which was unpleasant. The room wasn’t cleaned to standard. The only nice thing about the hotel was the bar staff and waiter. 
Overall extremely disappointed and won’t go back there again."
440,"It was too pricy for the kind of construction. The room was really old and  small as well as the bed. The heater  was noisy, the bathroom hadn't a  glass at the  window so it was cold and noisy. The ""breakfast"" was really poor, just bad coffee, milk aith cereal and gummy pastries. The staff was rude and not welcoming at all."
441,"Room was not clean.  Bath tub had used shampoo bottles, clothing from previous guest on chair, note with phone # and name on bedside table, used soap in sink.  Bed was made and not slept in but the rest of room had been occupied.  We won't stay there again although I have been a guest there  off and on since 1981.  Sorry to loose it."
442,It would be a good idea to have a few hairdryers that guests could borrow.
443,"Room dirty no light in bedroom tv fuzzy No hair dryerBed badWon’t be back"
444,the visa card system didn't work properly
445,"- Shower hot/cold and shower head is too low (approx. 5.5 ft)
- Privacy (from hallway)
- Room is small (as expected though for the price)
- Stains on carpet/walls"
446,Our room had noise from the huge air handling units from the next door hotel. Ask for a quiet room.
447,Did not care for the hamburger/fish & chips restaurant attached.
448,Would like to have had coffee/continental breakfast available before 7:00 a.m.
449,N/A
450,I am tall and I didn't fit into the bathtub. I really didn't mind and thought it was comical. Perhaps they can remodel room 704's tub at some point.
451,Room was hot but opened window at night
452,"our room was next to elevator and all day,  it  was very noisy of the sound of elevator, therefore it was very hard to sleep. also bath room door was  not fited well,so it was very hard to open and close the door.  also no facirily of tea and coffee in the room.."
453,"They should not promised breakfast, it was really poor and badly served. Fruit was missing some days"
454,"The pillow was too big and uncomfortable The breakfast was awful, I would recommend not to offer breakfast, that way one knows she has to look for options in advance"
455,Almost none..
456,No parking
457,Mini bar fridge compressor.
458,Excelent service
459,The shower door stuck (hard to get out) but the staff was very apologetic and fixed it right away.
460,TV not good
461,the whole place needs to be undated.....carpets look old and dirty....bathrooms are a mess...the bathroom floor was bad the window in the bathroom needs improvement....NO clock in the room.....
462,"Security issue.  I realized my room door wouldnot lock behind me.  Maintenance found a bottle cap had been lodged in the door jam preventing it to lock.  Had I not realized I didn’t hear the door “click” there’s a good chance I’d have lost belongings.  Someone deliberately messed with the lock that way.  Hotel just shrugged and said “oh well- at least the deadbolt worked.”  Smh"
463,"We arrived at 6pm and had to wait for half an hour while she sorted the two guys in front of us, there was no communication from her to say sorry for the wait, then when we did get up I asked for some type of remuneration a round at the bar would have been fine but nothing. Then we got to room and the door opens onto the first bed which we had a room with two queen beds in for me and my son the room should have only one bed in it ,there was know were for us to put our bags so we had to move some furniture you wouldn't have wanted our party to be two couples . The shower head moved in and out of the wall the floor in the shower needs painting it's old, you could even put the dead lock on because it was out of line. Room 614 ""I want be recommending this hotel to my friends"""
464,I registered for a queen bed got two doubles they could not help me
465,Elevator noise a bit loud
466,"Breakfast was not very good, no bread etc."
467,"Breakfast should be highly improved. Very poor. They better remove breakfast from advertising as continental. 
No free parking, but this is San Francisco. you can find valet parking very near to hotel for 35 dollars per night."
468,"Staff behaviours , rude and highly aggressive delayes in service delivery, highly agitated toward questions about their state mind of arousal concerning staff shortages. Staff had to be reprimanded that l was a paying customer of the hotel and had a voice to be heard concerning advocacy. There were witnesses to the outbursts. I would not stay at this hotel again."
469,Some of the wall paper is peeling and my bed side lamp didnt work.  Kinda noisey outside in the morning.
470,"Hotel poore. I not sleep night 31 December, becouse in 2 AM in 1 January was fire alarm. All gust from hotel stay in the street. It was very,very cold. I was disappointed. I return my hom very tired."
471,"the service at the front desk was incredibly rude, I don't recall such attitude in any city/country I visited. definitely ruined our stay at the hotel. no wonder this place had plenty of rooms available 3 days before New Year booked in a week before check-in....to be more precise - we did not expect much, just the bare minimum, but were treated rudely from the start till finish with one particular ""manager"" behaving as if we were bothering him, talking really tough at us, demanding smth all the time. I hope the guy get fired eventually, the management of the hotel should realize how damaging this guy is to their business.also the breakfast was really poor - just a coffee, tea and some pastry"
472,The bed. Me and my boyfriend both got itchy skin after using the bed.
473,"Need More better working OutletsFix window in bathroom too coldMore blankets The Elevator sucked didn’t even get to use it to take our Luggage down"
474,Mattresses not great. Very loud draining in tub. Musty smell
475,"I left a cashmere scarf. I asked them to send it to me and I would pay for shipment. Mgmt and maid staff suffered in who was responsible.  I still haven’t received my scarf which maid staff said they would send.  Mgmt did not back up responsibility. Very sad."
476,no complaints!
477,Breakfast
478,I had to leave.
479,Something is very wrong with the fat lady at the reception. She is talking too much n too little work done . I wonder if she knows what is her problem even the bellman cannot stands her
480,Too stuffy in the room because there was no A/C. The shower door kept sliding and the water was coming outside the bath. The facilities were quite old. The receptionist was a bit unfriendly when we approached him with a question.
481,One of the staff attitudes was really bad
482,"They have no free parkings. 
The location can be good and bad. 
It can be good because it’s close to the union square.
It can be bad because all the noise from the street is with you at night. Hard to sleep"
483,no parking but thats san francisco!
484,The breakfast
485,"Bathroom seemed to be made for people under 5 foot (1,6M), as everything, including the shower, was low. There was no ar conditioning nor heating system, only a fan and a portable heater that seemed as old as the hotel. Almost all the staff was under the weather all the time, even told me something similar to ""f*** yourself"" for not giving enough tip to the luggage carrier. If you are not an american you will have a bad experience with hotel's staff behavior (the opposite of the pub next door).The safety deposit box is in the clerks' desk so even if you have the only key he knows what you are keeping there"
486,No AC
487,"the staff is very unfriendly. there is no hot water and cold water at hotel. the room is very small and noisy, the bath tub is dirty. Parking is extra $45 per day and you will need to give the key to staff and every time if you need your car, you will have to give them 30 mins to get it back."
488,"I noticed the staff, front desk agent, being very busy upon check-out. The bellman proceeded to help me but he came across as very irrate."
489,"My mother and I both had surgery and complications ( then allllll the bad things happened in our room wirh maintenance tgere frim 6 to 11.) Knowing how crummy the room WAS...and we were bedridden they woukd not provide 1  breakfast delivery for my Mom WE have to pay for valet for a car we are too sick to drive.
They goof up daily on my reservations. Stating we have to ck out when we already contacted Bookings.com! Too many mess up and non functioning items in a musty old SF room that we stated ABSOLUTELY not nesr lifts--quietest room only. Where did they stick us? Right next to the lift with noisy-- street AND bar racket! 
 In Disgust!
For 2 more nights there
They should be thanking us vs wanting to toss us out!"
490,"Like very old buildings, one cannot control the heat. But if too warm, window opens easily.  If it is cold I am sure they would send a small space heater.  Did not need it."
491,"This is nitpicky, but breakfast wasn't great.  Know it's a 'continental breakfast, but maybe bagels or bread and a toaster wouldn't go amiss."
492,"They don't have A/C but it's fine, at least you have 2 fans in your room"
493,"The Roma were pretty small, But okay"
494,"No bath towels,  beds were old"
495,Having to carry bags up stairs.
496,"room too small, not well maintained or clean, very noisy area, windows would not close to restrict the exterior sounds"
497,Nothing
498,"The room was extraordinarily hot, small and noise from the street was loud, especially early morning when garbage was collected and when the pub closed."
499,"Some footstep noise from hall and other floors. Window is facing to back, a wall."
500,Nothing!
501,"The bed is old an squishy, and the whole hotel is very funky.  The comforter on top of the bed was really gross and old.  Reminding me of  all those shows on where they show the germs you find on the bedding in hotels.  The room was cold, and there were no extra blankets.  The TV was impossible to change to channels you could watch-it was mostly analog with static.  And the breakfast was cereal in a bin, some fruit, and some pastries.  It cost close to $377 which was shocking considering the quality."
502,They use a cleanser that stinks. I didn't know a room or bathroom could be so small. The sink and toilet are so near each other that you have to maneuver your body to sit on The toilet. The shower water pressure sucked. The soap was cheap. Breakfast was basic and not good: bad coffee and cheap pastries.
503,"The lady checking inn seemed too stressed out and the hotel looked kind of old and dirty ish... The hotel looked much, much more better in pictures..."
504,Two rooms that should have ironing boards didn't.
505,When we walked in our room there was a neighbouring generator whirring away outside our room. We complained to the front desk and were assured it would stop by 10.00pm. IT DIDN'T!!! It ran all night and we hardly slept. The Receptionist lied to us. Next morning we checked out totally disgusted. We had booked 3 nights but could only manage one. Other guests we spoke with had similar problems. We went elsewhere.
506,"Room smelt of urine, window didn’t close properly so it was noisy"
507,Smell in hotel is unacceptable.
508,"Very old hotel, terrible smell in hotel. Woke up at night because of smell. Room was clean as it could be but smell was just to much. There was nothing positive about this hotel"
509,Loud in the morning
510,Breakfast was just marginal. Not much offered except cold cereal and stale pastry. Milk for the cereal was sour.
511,Small room. Hot
512,Room
513,"Rotten timber in bathroom, bedroom hot, no air conditioner working, shower over bath, took forever to drain so standing in water, paper plates and plastic cutlery for gross breakfast"
514,"Staff, attitute towards foreigners"
515,Staff arrogant. A lot of noise all night. Room smell. Bed sheets had hair. No AC or heat. Upon return of my car we smell weed odor inside our vehicle.
516,"Bad breakfast Broken blind and lamps"
517,The room doesn't have any air conditioning. Though it is generally cold in San Francisco but there should be an AC at least to deal with suffocation. I stayed in a 7th floor room and it is not wise to keep the window open. Kids can fail down as the height is low.
518,No view.
519,Rooms were old and tired. Plumbing was noisy at night. Breakfast was continental and paper cups and croissants.
520,"Tiny room, no hair dryer"
521,1. The hotel has 1 elevator for guests  and for the cleaning stuf.  It is very slow and noisy. 2. The lobby is tiny and crowded with guests. 3. The parking is only a valet service and it is not clearly indicated that it has a charge of 47 dollars per day.4 the room is not ventalated properly. 5. The bathroom is very old and has a smell of mold 6. The breakfast is really bad served in a darkish pub. 7 the pub at night is terribly noisy-full of people that shout.8 the room is not noise isolated- we had a person next door that was banging at the wall .9 the lightning of the room is absolutely non existant not enough lite.
522,"The breakfast could have been a little better, but with tons of restaurants around, it wasn't that hard to find food."
523,"Needs updated and repairs
Staff could have been more welcoming and hospitable"
524,"Staff was rude at times and inflexible with payment options when splitting the payment. The hotel is in downtown, which normally would be a good thing, but for the incredibly costly parking everywhere. They offer valet parking at $40+/day for their own customers when they could easily provide a client discount. Count on spending at least $35/day just to find parking near the hotel."
525,It needed some plumbing work in the shower faucets.
526,The room did not have a/c. It only had a plug in fan. We really did not like that there was no ventilation for our room. The shower would only have really hot water or really cold water. For some reason would not combine the two to make luke warm water. The water jets in the bath tub looked like they had mildew in them
527,"Poorly staffed,  advertised breakfast turned out to be a skimpy continental breakfast also no A/C"
528,"Old and need maintenance and renovation 
Too expensive for what it offers."
529,Nothing
530,"It was freezing cold as there is no closable window in the bathroom. Most of the staff is totally unfriendly. Only a few hair dryers available, first come, first serve. On top of that you hear the AC of the neighbor building which is super loud. You have to yell at each other when in the bathroom!! No earplugs are available and our good ones couldn't even help. 
When we came to get breakfast at 8.30 the first time everything was already gone and they didn't fill up all of the things. 
I'm not a picky person at all and travel a lot but even 10$ rooms in Asia are nicer."
531,"Everything was perfect, nothing negative to comment on."
532,Small room with very small bathroom and closest. Furniture falling apart. Not comfortable. Had to request what is considered standard in other hotels: alarm clock and hair dryer. Not plug in convenient for sleep apnea machine.
533,no complaints.
534,Wish the room had ac
535,The room is very small. Bathroom is nothing to write home about. No AC in the room but there was a fan to put in the window. There was an ancient heater that we couldn’t figure out how to turn off so the breeze coming in from outside and the heater were dueling all night. This was the best option available to us in our price range and it was a good stay but I don’t know if I would return.
536,"good location, clean, good experience"
537,Breakfast was nothing great
538,It was so hot in the room.
539,"Only one member of staff was polite and helpful, the others were rude, abrupt and didn't have any customer service skills at all. When checking out the gentlemen did not even make eye contact with me and simply pushed the piece of paper to me to sign without saying a word.
If you turn left from the hotel you end up in the tenderloin, which is sketchy but this isn't mentioned by the staff but should be as its so close.
Noisy room close to a generator, recommend ear plugs."
540,The tv/refrigerator stand had significant water damage and was coming apart. The room was so hot even in November. There was a fan which helped but that was unexpected.
541,Badly peeling paint on the radiator. Carpeted base board falling off. No coffee makers in rooms. Coffee only available from 7a-10a.
542,Older building with elevator and street noise.  Bathroom updated.  Bedspreads could have been changed out for something from this century.   Bedding light weight in a room with old steam heating system controlled by the front desk.
543,"Bathroom fittings needed an upgrade. Furniture in the room was a little dated, dark wood making the room seem a bit gloomy inside. The room we had, had window looking out into an alleyway so didn’t get much light. We needed the light on even during the day. Although the room was clean, it smelt a tad musty."
544,"Wasn’t clean. Behind reception desk was untidy and dirty. 
Our bedroom was poor - sliding door to bathroom was cranky, bathroom not good, but shower worked, but certainly didn’t look inviting windows very unclean. 
View from window was of all the air vents. 
Breakfast was in the dingy pub, very poor, paper plates etc... and they had a ‘tip’ jar on the table... unbelievable!
The porter seemed to have some mental health problems... quite rude, and they ‘misplaced’ a carrier bag of ours in the luggage room."
545,"No hair dryer or coffee maker in the room. Bathroom was rundown, closet was miniscule."
546,No Airconditioning and incredibly loud rooms
547,"Heater kept turning on, and could only be turned off by the front desk."
548,It was a bit too hot in our room
549,"The breakfast was a sad affair. Sad cereal in a little single use plastic bowl, in a dark little (bar?) room. It wasn't really a place to get breakfast, even if it was already part of the booking."
550,I would have liked to see some sort of protein available for breakfast. Peanut butter or greek yogurt would be easy to add to the otherwise satisfactory continental breakfast.
551,Very small rooms. Front office staff not very friendly.
552,"No air-con and a bit noisy from equipment on the building outside the 6th floor window. We were so tired it didn't matter much.
The hallway stank of disinfectant each afternoon but it faded as the week went on so presumably they had cleaned up an incident shortly before we arrived. No smell in the room. 
No gluten free options at breakfast."
553,the front desk personal was not particularly friendly
554,"The neighborhood had a lot of homeless as did all the areas, even by the named hotels. It was just uncomfortable to see."
555,Breakfast could have been replenished in a more timely fashion.
556,Decor is a bit dated and maybe a better breakfast selection and no tea or coffee in the room
557,Basic continental Breakfast
558,No air conditioning
559,The hotel whilst trying to stay boutique is in need of being freshened up.
560,Parking was very expensive.
561,No parking so you have to find a street parking.
562,Bed uncomfortable.
563,Breakfast was very basic.
564,"The breakfast was free, but it was still a bunch of stale crossaints and pastries."
565,"day receptions was just arrogant and everytime i asked a question gave me a snark reply like i should have known the answer, as a first time visitor the the USA and to your hotel i dont know how i am expected to know the procedures of Valet parking and breakfast facilities."
566,"Small amount of mold on the bathroom shower ceiling (which I noticed while in the shower) really cheep thin toilet paper, otherwise very clean and nice (fresh paint).  Small room, cozy, romantic-- I will stay there again."
567,Lack of air conditioning meant leaving windows closed during a time of poor air quality in SF. Room can get very stuffy.  Continental breakfast is poor quality and not well tended to.
568,staff not very knowledgeable about transportation.. Very Rude
569,"Hotel is a little tired in terms of facilities, but it's not a major hotel chain so too be expected."
570,"The plumbing was loud, when you flushed the toilet it took awhile before the noise ended."
571,No air con. Very small bathroom
572,"The concierge office could do with a lick of paint. It looks shabby and doesn’t make for a good first impression. The restaurant/bar is intended to be styled on an English pub, the problem is the model is one from forty plus years ago. The impression comes out somewhere between a Berni Inn and Yates Wine lodge. Just needs a little rethinking to make it less gloomy."
573,Obviously old. Bathroom faucets could have been replaced.
574,"Reception staff which is rude  ( the old guy), the breakfast is very very weak and they dont recharge which is missing at the breakfast. Room is small and dont have a descent closet to hang things"
575,The windows weren't great - left in plenty of noise from a generator outside.
576,"1.  the shower door leaked water all across the floor2.  No air conditioner, leaving room too hot and muggy."
577,People in the room next to ours were smoking. The smoke was coming into our room thru a wall vent. I had complained to the management. I'm sure the management said something to them but they didn't stop.
578,Lack of electric jug in the room
579,the wifi seemed very slow. my key card had to be replaced...I imagine it's because I kept it near my phone?
580,"Rooms were quite dated, but still clean and comfortable."
581,Old
582,Crowded and unproffesional front desk
583,"I called twice to verify whether or not parking was included. They told me it was included.  When I got there they told me it was not. Staff was pretty rude. There was no AC. Had to open the windows without screens, pretty unnerving do to the fact the windows were 2 ft from the ground. Wouldn't suggest drinking. Could easily fall out."
584,Somewhat noisy. But that is a feature more so of the neighborhood than the hotel.
585,"The hotel is very outdated. Paint and wallpaper was peeling off the walls. Very noisy both inside the hotel through the walls and outside noise. No aircon in the room. The bathroom window did not close so there was cold air coming in when showering or using the bathroom. Very dusty rooms, no coffee or tea facilities in the room."
586,"Strangely configured hotel rooms.  Poor quality furnishings, needs updating.  bathrooms shabby.  Cleaning was poor, dirt on the walks and floors behind the doors.  Too far out of town.  Would not stay here again."
587,The lady behind the bar on Wed night was horrible
588,"Terrible breakfast, looked grubby. One morning all they had was coffee and muffins!!! That is not a continental breakfast. Hotel smelt terrible and is in desperate need of a update. Staff not overly friendly either. I will be advising any friends or family looking to go to San Fran NOT to stay here."
589,"Room window was a sash window and could  open all the way! We were on the 6th floor and as it’s a low window sill, it was an extremely dangerous health and safety issue. There was no aircon in room.  No hair dryer either."
590,"The room did not smell good.  There was a strong smell of cigarette smoke coming from the bathroom vent. Smoking is allowed at the Hotel but clearly the smell carrys through the ventilation system. 
Basic unexciting breakfast in a dark dingy room.
The room has no safety deposit, no hairdryer, no hot water facility. But reception will resolve these if you ask.
Bathroom is dated but adequate. The water temperature hard to control and changes suddenly from cold to scalding. Not a relaxing situation."
591,Unmaintained dirty very small room no air conditioning nothing like on website and I should have read reviews this is well below anywhere I have stayed in the world  man behind desk was rude and was talk of discussion at breakfast needs  to lift game should be rated 1 star at best
592,---
593,Nothing. It was fine.
594,"The toilets were weirdly very loud, after flushing they make a loud whooshing noise for about 4 minutes, annoying but not the worst thing."
595,I did have to ask 3 times for the phone in my room to be fixed. But otherwise all was great.
596,Nothing really
597,Noisy outside.
598,Double beds are too short
599,"Beds were not comfortable, our room had a leaky shower that leaked down a floor with a garbage can catching the drips right next to the apples at the continental breakfast. No AC and it was hot!  No screens on the windows either. It definitely had old world charm but no amenities. Staff were polite."
600,"The room was only big enough for 1 double and 1 twin bed, but we had enough room for 2 people"
601,Booking.com saying that the hotel is pet friendly and it is NOT really. We checked in and paid and upon finalizing our stay the reception informed us that we could not leave our dog unattended in the room. I asked her how we were supposed to go out to eat or to view San Francisco and her response was that we could order door dash! I told her the whole reason we came to San Francisco was to SEE some things in San Francisco and that I wanted a refund so I could find a hotel that was actually pet friendly. She said she could not give us a refund because they had a 24 hour cancellation policy! I was not informed until AFTER I had paid that I wasn’t going to be able to leave the hotel. So I paid almost $200 to sit in a hotel in San Francisco and eat take out.
602,"Breakfast is very unhealthy and poor, could be better. Rude staff, I called the reception desk to solve a problem and she yelled at me at the telephone. Didn't like that at all,"
603,"Terrible service, except one girl that apologized for her colleagues slightly nuts behavior! Ancient salad left in the minibar fridge. Brown water spluttered from the taps. Poor shower. Tiny tiny room. Ridiculously expensive for what it is."
604,"Noisy elevator, old and not so fresh furniture."
605,"Shabby interior, very run down"
606,"Bathroom door broken, literally doesn’t close."
607,"This property is very loud at night. There is no air conditioner, so the windows had to be left open. The room was extremely small for the amount of money paid."
608,"Breakfast was Terrible, we found cockroaches in the room, we couldn't sleep all night because engines were on all night long, they could not provide us a better room because all of them have the same problem. Their windows are not soundproof and not maintained at all."
609,"Noisy and small room, bathroom too dated, “continental breakfast” was an absolute joke: no staff to help, no fresh water to drink, paper plates, lack of variety of food, flies going everywhere, etc."
610,Very noisy room because of generator noise outside of building which we were told would stop at 10.00 pm but went all night. They did change us the next day to another room.
611,The shower was broken and the handles on furniture were missing.. All the furniture needs to be replace. They gave for breakast coffe and bread..
612,A variety of pillows depths would've been appreciated. The pillows were too thick for my liking.
613,Perhaps they can add more variety to the breakfast menu?
